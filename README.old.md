# Ninebarc Frontend coding challenge
Thanks for your interest in Ninebarc and for taking the time to do our coding challenge. We hope you enjoy developing it as much as we did :)

## Background
A lot of people come to Berlin for short trips and holiday. They often don‚Äôt know how to decide what ticket to get in order to use the city‚Äôs public transport. There are several ticket options based on the amount of stations per trip, how much time the person is staying in the city, their age and so on.

## Task
You need to create a simple web application to help decide the user what BVG Ticket to buy.

### Frontend
You need to create a `React` application that:
- Asks the user for their name.
- Starts asking the user a question (it could be `How much time are you planning on staying in the city` but we leave it up to you how many and what kind of questions to ask), and based on the response it will ask another relevant question. This will simulate a simple `decision tree`.
- At the end of the questionnaire, the application should recommend a ticket to the user in a final page that will also summarize the questions asked previously.

## Design 
No guidelines here, but we'd love to be impressed üòÅ.

## Technologies
Any of the following are allowed: React.js, JavaScript, Typescript, HTML, CSS

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit your project in a public Github repo and send us the `url` üôÇ.
- Include a README.md with instructions on how to run it, together with any additional information you consider appropriate (assumptions, design decisions made, etc.)
